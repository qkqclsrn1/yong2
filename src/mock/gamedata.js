    content1: `We set out to build the Otherside with one thing in mind: the
            metaverse should be anything but boring. The world should be
            dynamic, steeped in narrative, and your actions should hold
            consequence. Step into the Otherside, where the normal rules do not
            apply. Where you end up is up to chance. Where you go is up to you.
            The Otherside is part galaxy and part archipelago, with islands
            extending from the Biogenic Swamp at the center and roiling outwards
            to the Infinite Expanse. There are five sediments that lands are
            built upon: Biogenic Swamp, Chemical Goo, Rainbow Atmos, Cosmic
            Dream, and Infinite Expanse. Your Otherdeed is the key to a unique
            blend of environment, sediment, and treasures — some with resources,
            some home to powerful artifacts. And on a very few, a Koda roams.`,
    content2: `Meet the Kodas, the primal beings that have ushered us into the
            Otherside. We don’t know why they’ve brought us here, or what their
            affinity to this land is. If you are lucky enough to meet a Koda,
            tread cautiously. Koda 1 Koda 2 Every piece of land in the Otherside
            nurtures up to four replenishing resources that you will be able to
            harvest and utilize. Anima, Ore, Shard, and Root. Some are rare,
            some less so. These are the raw materials you will use to shape this
            world.`,
    content3: `Scattered throughout the lands of Otherside are rare objects, some
            of which cannot be crafted by any other means. If you find an
            artifact, know that it may hold secrets to this world as it expands.
            Every Otherdeed is a dynamic NFT, built as a collection of all of
            its elements, from resources to Kodas. Rather than a static
            representation of a piece of land, your Otherdeed is designed to
            evolve along with what you choose to do in the game.`,

    content1: `The Sandbox team is building a unique virtual world where players can build, own, and monetize
        their gaming experiences using SAND, the main utility token of the platform.
        SAND holders will be also able to participate in governance of the platform via a Decentralized
        Autonomous Organization (DAO), where they can exercise voting rights on key decisions of The
        Sandbox ecosystem. As a player, you can create digital assets (Non-Fungible Tokens, aka NFTs),
        upload them to the marketplace, and drag-and-drop them to create game experiences with The
        Sandbox Game Maker. The Sandbox has secured over 50 partnerships including Atari, Crypto Kitties,
        and Shaun the Sheep to build a fun, creative “play-to-earn” Gaming platform, owned and made by
        players.`,
    content2: `The Sandbox gaming ecosystem consists of three integrated products that together provide a
        comprehensive experience for user-generated content (UGC) content production.
        VOXEDIT: This simple to use yet powerful free 3D voxel modelling package allows users to
        create and animate 3D objects such as people, animals, foliage, and tools, and export them
        into The Sandbox marketplace to become game ASSETS.
        MARKETPLACE: The Sandbox’s web-based marketplace allows users to upload, publish, and
        sell their creations (ASSETS) made in VoxEdit, as Tokens (Both ERC-721 and ERC-1155
        tokens).`,
    content3: `The Sandbox virtual world uses blockchain technology and NFTs to empower the players and
        creators. NFTs are an emerging segment in the global game market: virtual tokens for digital scarcity,
        security and authenticity. Each NFT is distinct or unique, it is indivisible and it is not interchangeable
        for another.
        TRUE DIGITAL OWNERSHIP: Gamers are the true and perpetual owners of their digital items,
        even if the game was shut down or abandoned. With blockchain, every game item can be
        tokenized, allowing gamers to decide how they want to trade, sell, or gift their items.
        SECURITY AND IMMUTABILITY: Digital game items can be easily tokenized and traded in
        primary and secondary markets that are managed and facilitated by blockchain technology.
        Items based on scarcity and demand usually invite fraud and theft, but these risks are
        minimised on blockchain because it is a distributed ledger.`,
